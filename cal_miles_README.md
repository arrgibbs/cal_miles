The Cal Mileage application enables transportation compaines to calculate distance for an orgine destination pair of locations 
with intermdiate stop off points. The application was developed to locate city, state, zip codes and latitude/longitude. 
In addition, this allows transportation compaines to track hub routes and optimize a sequence of tracking truck stops and truck mileages.
The application was developed in VB.Net function codes in VS 2010 to provide a way to interact with the connectivity Dynamic Link Library (DLL).
It was developed to start up and shut down the server engin, create and configure trips, employ trip options, calculate routes and extract data.
On the backend the application was developed with SQL assemblies and functions to enable SQL server to communicate to the Dynamic Link Library(DLL).
The application was developed for confiuring Internet Information Services(IIS) using 64 bit or x64 platform which set the DLL to run the software program.

Please keep in mind this is only to show my codes and my work for new opportunities. I will continue to upload my codes for future projects.
